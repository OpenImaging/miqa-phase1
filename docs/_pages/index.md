# **M**edical **I**mage **Q**uality **A**ssurance **(MIQA)**

MIQA is designed for medical imaging QA/QC from the ground up, enabling workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of distributed medical imaging studies, but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans.
